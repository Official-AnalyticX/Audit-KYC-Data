AnalyticX is committed to providing comprehensive audits of Solidity source codes, commonly known as smart contracts. In our meticulous analysis, we focus on identifying vulnerabilities, centralization exploits, and potential cybersecurity concerns within the framework and algorithms of the audited smart contract.

This limited report represents a condensed summary of our findings, reflecting industry best practices as of the report's date. It is important to emphasize that while we have undertaken rigorous efforts to assess and compile this report, it should not be solely relied upon. We cannot assume liability for the report's contents, production, or implications. It is imperative that you conduct your independent investigations before making any decisions related to the audited smart contract.

SCOPE OF AUDIT
Our audit scope predominantly revolves around the security analysis of the smart contract code itself. It does not extend to other areas beyond the programming language, such as the compiler layer. Furthermore, this audit report does not cover broader project aspects, including business models or legal compliance. It's crucial to note that this report does not guarantee the absolute absence of bugs within the smart contract.

CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS AND TECHNICAL RISKS
Cryptographic tokens, particularly those associated with emerging technologies, inherently carry significant technical risks and uncertainties. By accessing our services, including reports and materials, you acknowledge that you do so at your own risk, accepting an "as-is, where-is, and as-available" basis. Please be aware that this audit report may include false positives, false negatives, and other unpredictable results.

CONFIDENTIALITY
The confidentiality of this report is paramount. It is subject to the terms and conditions outlined in the audit scope provided to the client. Without prior written consent from AnalyticX, this report should not be transmitted, disclosed, referred to, or relied upon by any individual for any purpose.
